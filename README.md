# pandas-challenge Report

From the analysis performed on the data provided, the goal of the task was to determine if charter schools out-performed public district schools across metrics due to its size as it has been found that smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-perform large sized schools on passing math performance.  

# School size affects academic achievement in math and reading
The data shows an inverse correlation between school size (as measured by student population) and average math score as well as an inverse correlation between school size (as measured by student population) and average reading score.  Medium sized schools have the highest percentage of students passing math (93.60%) as well as the highest percentage of students passing reading (96.79%).  These percentages are only slightly higher than that of small sized schools, with the percentage of students passing math at 93.55%) as well as the highest percentage of students passing reading (96.79%).  Large size schools have comparatively lower scores in percentage of students passing math (69.96%) and percentage of students passing reading (82.77%).  The overall passing of both math and reading, as measured by students achieving 70% and higher in both subjects is similar for small and medium sized schools (within one percentage point) at 90%, but is only at 58.29% for large sized schools.  

# Higher school budget per student does not yield higher academic achievement in math and reading
Given that there is an inverse relationship between spending ranges and overall percentage of students who achieve 70% in both math and reading, it does not appear that spending more money on a school yields better academic achievements in those subjects.  

# Conclusion 1: Charter schools benefit from its smaller student population
Given that the highest performing schools are charter schools and bottom performing schools are district schools, and charter schools are small and medium sized schools while district schools are all large sized schools, it can be argued generally that charter schools yield students with higher academic achievements in math and reading due to its smaller student population.  

# Conclusion 2: Size alone can’t explain the better academic achievement of charter schools
Although smaller student populations are consistent with better performance, size alone is not the only factor in determining student achievement in math and reading.  Wilson High School, which is a charter school with a student population of 2283 students outperformed all district schools, with a percentage of overall passing both math and reading at 90.58%, while the highest achieving district school in that metric was 54.64%.  This fact doesn’t fall within the narrative that district schools outperform district schools solely on its smaller size.  This particular district school ranks fourth overall in performance despite being large in size.  Size alone can’t explain the better performance of charter schools.
